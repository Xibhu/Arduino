# XibTimer Library

This library is a timer, allows you to execute code every "X" time. You can enable or disable it. Also you can change the time if needed.

You SHOULD use it to avoid the function "delay()" and start to make code with a bit of "multithread" (not real, but in arduino seems that).

You can see how to use this library in the folder `Example`.
